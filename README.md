# dragonflight-dashboard
A simple wow addon to display some useful infomation for dragon flying
Currently xy cord, speed, heading is displayed
Pitch display is troublesome due to the deletion of relative api

Basic addon structure and ui comes from the [SpeedO addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/speedo), the gliding speed api info and example comes from [wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/API_C_PlayerInfo.GetGlidingInfo)
