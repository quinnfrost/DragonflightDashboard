A minimal, minimal, minimal wow addon displays some useful infomation for dragon flying

Basic addon structure and ui comes from the [SpeedO addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/speedo), the gliding speed api info and example comes from [wowpedia](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/API_C_PlayerInfo.GetGlidingInfo)

A small frame shows up at bottom left corner once addon is loaded, from left to right shows x,y cord, speed(delta speed), heading(delta heading in degree per second)

When dragon flying, speed shows different color for thrill of the skies (green), ground skimming (blue), both (purple), and stall (red)
